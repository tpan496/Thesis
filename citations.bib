    abstract="NonStop SQL is an implementation of ANSI SQL on Tandem Computer Systems. It provides distributed data and distributed execution. It can run on small computers and has been benchmarked at over 200 transactions per second on a large system. Hence, it is useable in both the information center and in production environments. NonStop SQL provides high-availability through a combination of NonStop device support and transaction mechanisms. The combination of SQL semantics and a message-based distributed operating system gives a surprising result: the message savings of a relational interface pay for the extra semantics of the SQL language when compared to record-at-a-time interfaces.",

abstract = {With memory prices dropping and memory sizes increasing accordingly, a number of researchers
are addressing the problem of designing high-performance database systems for managing
memory-resident data. In this paper we address the recovery problem in the context
of such a system. We argue that existing database recovery schemes fall short of meeting
the requirements of such a system, and we present a new recovery mechanism which is
designed to overcome their shortcomings. The proposed mechanism takes advantage of
a few megabytes of reliable memory in order to organize recovery information on a
per “object” basis. As a result, it is able to amortize the cost of checkpoints over
a controllable number of updates, and it is also able to separate post-crash recovery
into two phases—high-speed recovery of data which is needed immediately by transactions,
and background recovery of the remaining portions of the database. A simple performance
analysis is undertaken, and the results suggest our mechanism should perform well
in a high-performance, memory-resident database environment.},
