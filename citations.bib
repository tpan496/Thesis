pages="60--104",
abstract="NonStop SQL is an implementation of ANSI SQL on Tandem Computer Systems. It provides distributed data and distributed execution. It can run on small computers and has been benchmarked at over 200 transactions per second on a large system. Hence, it is useable in both the information center and in production environments. NonStop SQL provides high-availability through a combination of NonStop device support and transaction mechanisms. The combination of SQL semantics and a message-based distributed operating system gives a surprising result: the message savings of a relational interface pay for the extra semantics of the SQL language when compared to record-at-a-time interfaces.",
